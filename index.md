**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
Leveraging Google Cloud product services stood out as the most interesting topic.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Given the need to limit the number of users, I’d like to explore database management and tracking user activity volume.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
We’re still deciding between using API endpoints and gateways. This approach may shift in Quarter 2 based on our findings.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I’d like to dive deeper into APIs, particularly focusing on passing parameters and managing data flow.
